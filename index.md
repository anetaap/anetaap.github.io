### Current projects:

Together with my group, we are working on the PyChess project. We make a chess game because we think it's a very interesting game.♟

### PyChess

PhChess is a project which me and my frinds decided to do for the subject PhChess is a project that my friends and I decided to take as part of the subject of IT tools. Our goal was to create a chess game in python. We were inspired by similar games. Our goal has been achieved and we have managed to create chess that is playable! They are not perfect, but due to the amount of work in our studies, we were unable to refine them, but we put a lot of heart into them and we are proud that we were able to create this project from scratch.
We are glad that more and more people are interested in chess, among others due to the Netflix series "Queen's Gambit", which I liked very much by the way. We think that thanks to this the topic of our project was very timely.
And here is a photo of our board, it is very classic, and most importantly it fulfills its role.♥♟
